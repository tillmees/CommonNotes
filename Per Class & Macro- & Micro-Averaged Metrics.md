## Macro averaging
Computes precision for each class separately and then averages them, treating all classes equally.

##### For Memorizing
Macro -> In photography: Looking at the details -> Looking at the classes individually.

## Micro averaging
Computes precision globally by summing true positives and false positives across all classes.

##### For Memorizing
Micro -> Microphone: Loud, addressing everybody -> Looking at all the data at once.
