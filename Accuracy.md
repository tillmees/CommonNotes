Accuracy = Correct Predictions / Total Predictions

✅ **Good for:** Balanced datasets where **all classes are equally important**.  
❌ **Bad for:** **Imbalanced datasets**—a model can achieve high accuracy by favoring common classes.

For **multiclass problems** consider [[Per Class & Macro- & Micro-Averaged Metrics]].
